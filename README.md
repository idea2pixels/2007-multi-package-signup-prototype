# 2007-multi-package-signup-prototype 
# This is a prototype built in about a week using script.aculo.us late 2007 for a local online merchant.
# The purpose is to showcase a UX/UI that can allow configuration in a "single page view" - not to be confused with an SPA.
# Challenges: create a complex/multi-level package configuration where the price is visible and builds with the experience.
